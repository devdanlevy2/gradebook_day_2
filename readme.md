## estimate

     Before starting this project I thought that it would take 16 hours based on the
fact that it was a two day assignment using several new tools.  Usually during the
course of the assignment I end up watching the class video for review.

     I ended up spending about 12 hours on the project and didn't complete the
assignment.  I got side-tracked on routing and authentication problems involving
the radio button and ended up running out of time.  I feel like I could have benefitted
from doing a review of the lessons before I dove head first into the assignment.
Also i realize that I did a terrible job with committing.  I got so into the flow
of work that I forgot to commit at several points.
